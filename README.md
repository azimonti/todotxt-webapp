# Todo.txt Webapp

A simple web application for managing your todo.txt file.

This webapp allows you to manage your tasks using the [todo.txt format](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt). It provides a simple web interface to view, add, and manage your todo items.

This project utilizes the [jsTodoTxt](https://github.com/jmhobbs/jsTodoTxt) library by jmhobbs for parsing and manipulating todo.txt format. We appreciate the work of jmhobbs and the contributors to jsTodoTxt.

## Usage

To use the webapp for development:

1. **Install Node.js dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```
This command installs the necessary packages for the development server.

2. **Start the development server:**
```bash
node node-server.js
```
This command launches the Node.js server, which will serve the webapp.

3. **Open `index.html` in your web browser:**
Once the server is running, you can access the webapp by opening `index.html` in your browser. Typically, the server will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.
